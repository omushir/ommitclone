Objective: Implement the following features within the provided project:
1. Motion Animations:
○ Build the following animations under the ‘Motion’ category:
■ Move
____ steps
■ turn
____ degrees
■ Go to x:
___ y: ____
■ Repeat animation (inside controls)
○ Ensure all corresponding drag-and-drop functionalities, as seen in the
Scratch app, are covered.
2. Multiple Sprites Support:
○ Add functionality to create multiple ‘Sprites.’
○ Ensure the animations from Feature 1 are available for each Sprite.
○ Implement a play button on click of which all Sprites starts animating
3. Hero Feature- Collision-Based Animation Swap:
○ Introduce a "Hero Feature" that swaps animations when two characters
collide.
○ Example:
■ Character 1: [Move 10 steps, repeat animation]
■ Character 2: [Move -10 steps, repeat animation]
■ After collision, the animations swap:
■ Character 1: Move -10 steps
■ Character 2: Move 10 steps
○ This feature adds dynamic interaction between characters in the Scratch
playground.
